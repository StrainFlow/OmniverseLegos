# Omniverse Legos

This is a repo where I will be converting lego sets to USD format and assembling them so that they can be animated in Nvidia Omniverse. 

If you want to convert a lego set the process is as follows:

1. Install Bricklink studio: [https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page]
2. Import the model of your choice
3. Build the model, but keep any moving parts separate from each other. 
4. Export to sketchfab
5. download as .usdz from sketchfab
6. change file extension to .zip
7. extract the zip file
8. open the usdc file in Create
9. Rig the model up with physics....I'm learning this part myself.
