# Omniverse Legos

This is a repo where I will be converting lego sets to USD format and assembling them so that they can be animated in Nvidia Omniverse. 

If you want to convert a lego set the process is as follows:

1. Install Bricklink studio: [https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page]
2. Import the model of your choice
3. Build the model, but keep any moving parts separate from each other. 
4. Save the bricklink file in case you need to make revisions later
5. Export from bricklink to sketchfab (there is a direct export link in bricklink studio)
6. download as .usdz from sketchfab
7. change file extension to .zip
8. extract the zip file
9. open the usdc file in Create
10. Rig the model up with physics....I'm learning this part myself.
11. I'm saving as a USDA file for better git compatibility
